Hi:)
Here is my mini data analysis project for kaggle data visualization course. 


In this toturial we learn how to use seaborn more accurate, visulizing regression among parameters in database and more:)

It's a data of student(reading,writing and math score) we try to find any particular correlation between hese scores and students backgrounds such as parental education state and more. 

Hope you enjoy it!
Cheers!
Mehrsa
